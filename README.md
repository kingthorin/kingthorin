### 🔭 I’m currently working on:

- Projects which I co-lead:
  - [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) and its [add-ons](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions), etc.
    - I'm currently the author/maintainer of the [Neonmarker Add-on](https://github.com/kingthorin/neonmarker).
  - The [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg).
    - [Web deployed version](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/).
  - The [OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-VWAD).

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- [Job Summaries](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/) for GitHub actions.
- GitHub Actions. I like building things that use a lot of CLI'ish stuff.
  - now looking into composite actions and hoping GitHub will add something that facilitates yaml based composition. (Ex: Here's my yaml that does commenting, use it in 3 workflows for this repo/org.)
