    - I'm currently the author/maintainer of the [Neonmarker Add-on](https://github.com/kingthorin/neonmarker).

### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
- GitHub Actions. I like building things that use a lot of CLI'ish stuff.
  - now looking into composite actions and hoping GitHub will add something that facilitates yaml based composition. (Ex: Here's my yaml that does commenting, use it in 3 workflows for this repo/org.)
  - `pull_request_target` has been great in order to facilitate commenting and labeling PRs from forked repos.
